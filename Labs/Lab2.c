//1
//The extra step we take is adding 1 to our complemented(flipping bites) number.
//A good way of remember this is to comprement the name of the representation schemes. 
//2. 1. 10111
//   2. 10101
//   3. 11001
//   4. 11111
//3. In 2's complement, all the positive numbers begin with a 0.
//4. In 2's complement we have only ine way to represent 0. This simplifies our representaiton schemes and have major advantage for designing hardwares.

//5. change to binary number 
//6. make binary number that is 7 and flip the bits and add 1
//7. If the number is positive just change to binary number. If not, change the decimal number to positive and change to binary number and flip the bits then add 1.
//8. 1. 110000
//   2. 001101
//   3. 111101
//   4. 110110
//   5. 011010
//   6. 100001
